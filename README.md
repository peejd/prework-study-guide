# Philip's UNC Bootcamp Prework Study Guide

## Description

This Study Guide was built in anticipation of a large slew of information that I will want to retain and consequently reference as I  work through the UNC Coding Boot Camp. 

Ultimately, this webpage will store, categorize, and organize my many notes on the various subjects I will learn about in the course of the Boot Camp. This creates a user-friendly means to quickly locate notes that pertain to a specific coding language or development process so that I don't have to scan across many folders on my local computer or pages online to find the information I seek.

In the process of building this site, I learned some fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git/GitHub which will surely prove useful in my future career as a web developer.

The notes in this Prework Study Guide are categorized by development proficiency or topic. Currently these include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git / GitHub. If we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. For now, this JavaScript simply lists the topics we learned in the Prework and randomly chooses one topic for us to study first.
