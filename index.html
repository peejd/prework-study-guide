          <li>CSS can be applied using three methods: Inline, internal, or external.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A selector defines which portion of HTML to which a given style should be applied.</li>
          <li>A style declaration contains a property and corresponding value.</li>
          <li>The "display: block" value assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <li>The "*" is a wildcard which means "all".</li>
          <li>To link an external CSS style sheet to an HTML page, the "link" element must be inserted into the "head" element after the final "meta" element and before the "title" element".</li>
